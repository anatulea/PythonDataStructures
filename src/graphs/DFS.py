'''
PathsÂ¶
We are able to tweak both of the previous implementations to return all possible paths between a start and goal vertex. The implementation below uses the stack data-structure again to iteratively solve the problem, yielding each possible path when we locate the goal. Using a generator allows the user to only compute the desired amount of alternative paths.

    stack = [(start, [start])]
    while stack:
        (vertex, path) = stack.pop()
        for nxt in graph[vertex] - set(path):
            if nxt == goal:
                yield path + [nxt]
            else:
                stack.append((nxt, path + [nxt]))

print(list(dfs_paths(graph1, 'A', 'F')))
